Address Book - This code is an address book for the students in my shop class. When you run the code, it will print out the different variables on an ID card and display their names, ages, emails, Grades, and whether or not they have a driver's license. The Code consists of variable inputs such as strings, floats, integers, and bools. It then outputs these variables on an ID Card.
